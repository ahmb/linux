#bash_profile is run for login shells and bashrc is run for noninteractive login shells i.e not a first time login for a user
#to consolidate configuration into one file instead of two:
#Add the following lines to .bash_profile:
#edit: or simply create a symbolic link :p
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
